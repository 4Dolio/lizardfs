Installing LizardFS from source.


Current LizardFS source code can be obtained at:

   http://lizardfs.com/download/


LizardFS uses cmake as its build system. To compile the sources, follow
the directions outlined below.

1. Create a build directory inside the source directory.

    cd lizardfs-source
    mkdir build

2. Run 'cmake ..' inside the build directory. Useful options include
   '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX', '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE' as well as various
   LizardFS-specific '-DENABLE_...' options. Options are listed when
   cmake is ran and can be changed by re-running cmake.

    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/lizardfs

3. Run make in the build directory.

    make

4. Run make install to install files (you may need to be root).

    make install
