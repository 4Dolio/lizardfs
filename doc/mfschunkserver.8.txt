== NAME

mfschunkserver - start, restart or stop Moose File System chunkserver process

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*mfschunkserver* [*-f*] [*-c* 'CFGFILE'] [*-u*] [*-d*] [*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'] ['ACTION']

[verse]
*mfschunkserver -s* [*-c* 'CFGFILE']

[verse]
*mfschunkserver -v*

[verse]
*mfschunkserver -h*


== DESCRIPTION

*mfschunkserver* is the data server of Moose File System. Depending on parameters it can start,
restart or stop MooseFS chunkserver process. Without any options it starts MooseFS chunkserver,
killing previously run process if lock file exists.

SIGHUP (or *reload* 'ACTION') forces *mfschunkserver* to reload all configuration files.

Starting with version 1.6.0 chunkserver periodically tests stored chunks (see *HDD_TEST_FREQ* option
in *mfschunkserver.cfg* manual).

Starting with version 1.6.5 MooseFS master doesn't send metadata change logs to chunkserver and
expect at least one *mfsmetalogger* daemon to connect.

Starting with version 1.6.26 chunkserver scans attached disks in background.

== OPTIONS

*-v*::
print version information and exit

*-h*::
print usage information and exit

*-f*::
(deprecated, use *start* action instead)
forcily run MooseFS chunkserver process, without trying to kill previous instance (this option
allows to run MooseFS chunkserver if stale PID file exists)

*-s*::
(deprecated, use *stop* action instead)
stop MooseFS chunkserver process

*-c* 'CFGFILE'::
specify alternative path of configuration file (default is *mfschunkserver.cfg* in system
configuration directory)

*-u*::
log undefined configuration values (when default is assumed)

*-d*::
run in foreground, don't daemonize

*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'::
how long to wait for lockfile (default is 60 seconds)

'ACTION'
is the one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *reload*, *test*, *isalive* or *kill*. Default action is
*restart* unless *-s* (stop) or *-f* (start) option is given. Note that *-s* and *-f* options are
deprecated, likely to disappear and 'ACTION' parameter to become obligatory in MooseFS 1.7.

== FILES

*mfschunkserver.cfg*::
configuration file for MooseFS chunkserver process; refer to *mfschunkserver.cfg*(5) manual for
defails

*mfshdd.cfg*::
list of directories (mountpoints) used for MooseFS storage (one per line; directory prefixed by ***
character causes given directory to be freed by replicating all data already stored there to another
locations)

*mfschunkserver.lock*::
PID file of running MooseFS chunkserver process
(created in RUN_PATH by MooseFS < 1.6.9)

*.mfschunkserver.lock*::
lock file of running MooseFS chunkserver process
(created in data directory since MooseFS 1.6.9)

*`changelog_csback.*.mfs`*::
MooseFS filesystem metadata change logs (backup of master change log files; used only with MooseFS
master < 1.6.5)

*data.csstats*::
Chunkserver charts state
