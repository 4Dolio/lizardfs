mfsgetgoal(1)
===========

== NAME

mfsgetgoal, mfssetgoal, mfsrgetgoal, mfsrsetgoal - change or retrieve goal

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*mfsgetgoal* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*mfsrgetgoal* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*mfssetgoal* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] [*+*|*-*]N|**xor**N 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*mfsrsetgoal* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] [*+*|*-*]N 'OBJECT'...

== DESCRIPTION

*mfsgetgoal* and *mfssetgoal* operate on object's 'goal' value. There are two types of goals:
ordinary goals (1..9) and xor goals (xor2..xor10). Ordinary 'goal' is the number of copies
in which all the file's data is stored. It means that the file should survive failure of
one less chunkservers than its 'goal' value. Ordinary 'goal' must be set between 1 and 9
(note that 1 is strongly unadvised).

For xor goals the number represents the 'xor level'. A file with the 'xor level' of 'N' has
all the chunks divided into 'N' parts (kept in one copy) and additionally there is a parity
part. It means that the disk space needed to store such a file if roughly equal to '(N+1)/N'
of the file's size and the file should survive failure of one of the chunkservers. Xor level
must be set between 2 and 10.

*mfsgetgoal* prints current 'goal' value of given object(s). These tools can be used on any file,
directory or deleted ('trash') file.

== OPTIONS

*-r*::
This option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every given file, but for every given
directory additionally prints current value of all contained objects (files and directories).

\[*+*|*-*]'N'::
*mfssetgoal* changes current 'goal' value of given object(s). If new value is specified in *+*'N'
form, 'goal' value is increased to 'N' for objects with lower 'goal' value and unchanged for
the rest. Similarly, if new value is specified as *-*'N', 'goal' value is decreased to 'N' for
objects with higher 'goal' value and unchanged for the rest.

*-n*, *-h*, *-H*::
These options are described in mfstools(1).

== NOTE

*mfsrgetgoal* and *mfsrsetgoal* are deprecated aliases for
*mfsgetgoal -r* and *mfssetgoal -r* respectively.
