== DESCRIPTION

*mfsmetalogger* is the metadata replication server of Moose File System. Depending on parameters it
can start, restart or stop MooseFS metalogger process. Without any options it starts MooseFS
metalogger, killing previously run process if lock file exists.

SIGHUP (or 'reload' 'ACTION') forces *mfsmetalogger* to reload all configuration files.

mfsmetalogger exists since 1.6.5 version of MooseFS; before this version *mfschunkserver*(8) was
responsible of logging metadata changes.

*-v*::
print version information and exit

*-h*::
print usage information and exit

*-f*::
(deprecated, use *start* action instead)
forcily run MooseFS metalogger process, without trying to kill previous instance (this option allows
to run MooseFS metalogger if stale PID file exists)

*-s*::
(deprecated, use *stop* action instead)
stop MooseFS metalogger process

*-c* 'CFGFILE'::
specify alternative path of configuration file (default is *mfsmetalogger.cfg* in system
configuration directory)

*-u*::
log undefined configuration values (when default is assumed)

*-d*::
run in foreground, don't daemonize

*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'::
how long to wait for lockfile (default is 60 seconds)

'ACTION'
is the one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *reload*, *test*, *isalive* or *kill*. Default action is
*restart* unless *-s* (stop) or *-f* (start) option is given. Note that *-s* and *-f* options are
deprecated, likely to disappear and 'ACTION' parameter to become obligatory in MooseFS 1.7.
