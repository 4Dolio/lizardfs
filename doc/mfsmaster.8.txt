== DESCRIPTION

*mfsmaster* is the metadata server program of Moose File System. Depending on parameters it can
start, restart or stop MooseFS metadata server process. Without any options it starts MooseFS
metadata server, killing previously run process if lock file exists.

Metadata server can work in one of two modes (personalities):

. master
. shadow

If metadata server works with 'master' personality it acts as main metadata server
govering all file system metadata modifications.
If metadata server works with 'shadow' personality it acts as backup metadata server
ready for immediate deployment as new 'master' in case of current 'master' failure.
Shadow only accepts connections from lizardfs-probe, i.e. mfschunkserver, mfsmetalogger
and mfsmount (the client) are not allowed to connect to 'shadow' instance.

Current metadata server personality is defined in metadata server configuration file
and can be changed on the fly from 'shadow' to 'master' by proper modification and reloading
of its configuration file.

SIGHUP (or 'reload' 'ACTION') forces *mfsmaster* to reload all configuration files.

*-v*::
print version information and exit

*-h*::
print usage information and exit

*-f*::
(deprecated, use *start* action instead)
forcily run MooseFS master process, without trying to kill
previous instance (this option allows to run MooseFS master if stale PID file exists)

*-s*::
(deprecated, use *stop* action instead)
stop MooseFS master process

*-c* 'CFGFILE'::
specify alternative path of configuration file (default is *mfsmaster.cfg* in system configuration
directory)

*-u*::
log undefined configuration values (when default is assumed)

*-d*::
run in foreground, don't daemonize

*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'::
how long to wait for lockfile (default is 60 seconds)

'ACTION'::
is the one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *reload*, *test*, *isalive* or *kill*. Default action is
*restart* unless *-s* (stop) or *-f* (start) option is given. Note that *-s* and *-f* options are
deprecated, likely to disappear and 'ACTION' parameter to become obligatory in MooseFS 1.7.
